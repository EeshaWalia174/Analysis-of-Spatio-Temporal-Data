# Analysis-of-Spatio-Temporal-Data
###  The Citi bike sharing program has enjoyed consistent growth since it started rolling in 2013 in Brooklyn, Newyork [1]. However, like any bike sharing system (BSS), Citi bike indeed has a downside when it comes to estimating the demand of bikes and docking spots required for the same and this is one of the most dynamic (difficult) aspects of bikeshare[2]. In this report we will conduct a spatio-temporal analysis of the patterns of demand in bikes to answer a few questions. Through this analysis Citi bike can understand the biking behavior of citizens of New York city and plan for more resources to meet demand and ensure customer satisfaction.


## Methods
### * A number of statistical methods are used to first analyse the the ride frequency as per gender and age group and station popularity. 
### * A temporal analyses is conducted to study the hourly and daily demand for bikes.
### * Spatial Interpolation is used to access the density of stations and rides at particular latitudes and longitudes.
